## Linting

`npm run lint`

This will also run on a pre-commit hook that will install on `npm i`

## Downloading A Build

You may want to install a development `.vsix` file, instead of installing this extension via the [VS Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=LocalCI.local-ci).

1. Click the commit check you want to download the `.vsix` for. This could be in a PR, or simply the `develop` branch.
2. For the package job, click Details.
3. Click the Artifacts tab
4. Click the `.vsix` file to download it:

## Testing A Build Locally

1. Enter the Command Palette, either through a shortcut, or View > Command Palette
2. Type 'Extensions: Install from VSIX'
3. Select the Local CI `.vsix` file, maybe the one you [downloaded](#downloading-a-build)
